parallelpickr -- WIP

A package with tools for identifying and assessing results from experiments with parallel trends.
Parallel trends experiments have applications in many fields, particularly economics and digital marketing.
Economists will find this package valuable for the quasi-experimental difference-in-differences method.
Marketers will find this package valuable for setting up and assessing advertising geo tests.
